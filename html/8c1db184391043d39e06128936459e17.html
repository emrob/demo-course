<h2>Hi! my name is....</h2>
<p>Now that you've successfully created a brand new Open edX course, you're going to want to start thinking about what you want that course to focus on, and how you're going to run it. Enter: The Course Summary page. This page is basically an information sheet about your course. It's got everything from general info to student requirements to whatever else you want to include in it!</p>
<p>Some people prefer to wait until they've finished adding all their course content before they&nbsp;edit the Course Summary page. That way they know exactly what to say about their course entails. However it can also be a good idea to start with the summary page so that your course has some defined direction right&nbsp;from the get-go.</p>
